# LiDAR-camera-calibration-summary
Summarizes mainstream LiDAR and camera calibration algorithms and public datasets


1. Summary of the current mainstream open-source LiDAR-camera calibration algorithms.We provide the algorithm's web links, sensor types, corresponding literature sources, and the calibration framework category to which it belongs.This summary will be continuously updated to provide a convenient and concise radar and camera calibration checklist for radar and camera calibration researchers. Suggestions are welcome, and we will strive to do better.
