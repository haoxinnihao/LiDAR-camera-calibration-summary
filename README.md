# LiDAR-camera-calibration-summary
## Summarizes mainstream LiDAR and camera calibration algorithms and public datasets


1. Summary of the current mainstream open-source LiDAR-camera calibration algorithms. We provide the algorithm's web links, sensor types, corresponding literature sources, and the calibration framework category to which it belongs. This summary will be continuously updated to provide a convenient and concise radar and camera calibration checklist for radar and camera calibration researchers. Suggestions are welcome, and we will strive to do better.
